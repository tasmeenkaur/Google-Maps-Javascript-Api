VERSIONS USED:

RUBY VERSION : 2.2.0P0

RAILS VERSION:4.2.0

1.What server framework did you choose and why?

I chose Ruby on Rails because it has object oriented approach and is a open source framework moreover it is easier to call RESTweb service with rails.Managing Database in ruby is also simple with creating models.Directory in Ruby on Rails is properly managed and understandable; One knows "who is who". We can develop website with Ruby on Rails with much more productivity.Rails is being used by top companies today for example hp, Intel, Nasa, Twitter

b. What client framework did you choose and why?

I chose JQUERY because it makes executing AJAX commands simpler.It loads the contents from server-side to client much faster.

c. What aspect of the implementation did you find easy, if any, and why?

It was easy too create database table in rails with creating a model also populating database was also simple with seed.rb file.We did not have to run queries for manaing database.

d. What aspect of the implementation did you find hard, if any, and why?

It was difficult initially to get into Rails. But after getting hands on it, it was easy to understand Ruby.

e. What components OTHER than your client and server framework did you install, if any, and if so, what is their purpose for your solution?
